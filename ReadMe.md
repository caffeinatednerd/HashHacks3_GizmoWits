# Real-time assistant for answering general queries of Indian farmers using AI  
## Problem Statement
  In India, most farmers are illiterate and have faced many crop failures over the last decade. Kisan call centres have also failed in providing the information efficiently to the farmers.
#### Examples 
  - A farmer in a particular area not knowing about the weather changes that are about to take place in the coming days even though we have technologies like Accuweather (Google Weather).
  - A farmer may not know about which pesticide is best for a particular plant species.
  
  This results in mass crop failures in many areas across India.
  
## Idea
  A real-time assistant which can answer all the general queries of farmers by taking in their voice input in local languages apart from English.
  
## Problems our Idea overcomes
  - Sudden Hike in prices of vegetables.
  - Mass farmer suicides and protests.
  - Crop import from other countries which decreases the GDP of the importing nation.

## Tech Stacks
  - Python 
    - Numpy, Pandas, NLTK, SciKit
    - Google Text To Speech, Yandex Translator API
